# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
### Purpose

The purpose of the analysis is to discover how many people are retiring from Pewlett-Hackard as to plan for the positions that will need to be filled in the future once an employee retires. As well to see which employees actually meet criteria for the retirement package. The company is upgrading how they store data, so helping the company store the HR data in SQL.  

## Results
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary
### Silver Tsunami

90398 is the number of roles that will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami” starts to make an impact when employees borned between Jan. 01, 1952 and Dec. 31, 1955 retire. The job roles that will be impacted the most are both the Senior Engineer (29,414 retirees) and Senior Staff (28,254).

The question lies as well with which departments are affected by this. It seems the job roles retiring the most are from the Development and Production. This could have a huge impact on duration of when new products and services are created and produced for the public. As many employees will be new and need to be trained in the company’s methods. 


### Next Generation

There are not enough eligible retirees to mentor the next generation of PH employees. The total amount of eligible employees is 1549. This comes from retiring employees with date of births between Jan. 01, 1955 and Dec. 31, 1965. Then the employees who do not have the desire to participate must be considered. If all 1549 are willing to participate that’s a 1:58 mentor to trainee ratio.

With no doubt would the mentorship eligibility fail unless the criteria are expanded. If expanded to current employees with birthdates between Jan. 01, 1952 and Dec. 31, 1955 then there would be total of 72458 eligible mentors. This would go better than the original mentorship eligibility criteria.
